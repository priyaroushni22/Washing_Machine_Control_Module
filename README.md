# Washing_Machine_Control_Module
The Washing Machine Control Module is designed to simulate the control logic of a washing machine using a finite state machine implemented in Verilog. It provides a modular and scalable solution for controlling the washing machine operations such as filling water, adding detergent, running cycles, draining water, and spinning
